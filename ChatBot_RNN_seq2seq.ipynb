      "27question:how are antibodies used in\n",
      "answer: The BCR is only found on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells , or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure \n",

      "38question:how are antibodies used in\n",
      "answer: The large and diverse population of antibodies is generated by random combinations of a set of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites ( or paratopes ) , followed by random mutations in this area of the antibody gene , which create further diversity \n",
      "39question:how are antibodies used in\n",

      "answer: American wire gauge ( AWG ) , also known as the Brown & Sharpe wire gauge , is a standardized wire gauge system used since 1857 predominantly in the United States and Canada for the diameters of round , solid , nonferrous , electrically conducting wire \n",
      "499question:how thick is 26 gauge wire\n",
      "answer: The cross-sectional area of each gauge is an important factor for determining its current-carrying capacity \n",

      "507question:how thick is 26 gauge wire\n",
      "answer: The AWG of a stranded wire is determined by the total cross-sectional area of the conductor , which determines its current-carrying capacity and electrical resistance \n",
      "508question:how thick is 26 gauge wire\n",
      "answer: Because there are also small gaps between the strands , a stranded wire will always have a slightly larger overall diameter than a solid wire with the same AWG \n",
